# Architecture of the Intelligent Document Search and Summarization Tool

## Overview
The Intelligent Document Search and Summarization Tool is designed to provide users with an efficient way to search and summarize documents using AI technologies. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Components
1. **Frontend**
   - Built using React, the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for document upload, query input, and displaying results.
   - Key components include:
     - **FileUpload**: Allows users to upload documents.
     - **QueryInput**: Enables users to enter search queries.
     - **ResultsDisplay**: Shows search results and summaries.

2. **Backend**
   - Developed with FastAPI, the backend handles API requests and processes documents.
   - Key modules include:
     - **API Routes**: Define endpoints for document upload, search, and summarization.
     - **Services**:
       - **Search Service**: Implements logic for searching documents using LLMs and vector databases.
       - **Summarization Service**: Generates concise summaries of document sections using LLMs.
     - **Models**: Defines the structure of documents being processed.
     - **Utils**: Contains utility functions for interacting with the vector database.

3. **Vector Database**
   - A vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS) is used to store document embeddings, enabling semantic search capabilities.

4. **AI Pipelines**
   - Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance search accuracy and summarization quality.
   - Integrates large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding and generation.

## Data Flow
1. Users upload documents through the frontend, which sends the files to the backend API.
2. The backend processes the documents, storing embeddings in the vector database.
3. When a user submits a search query, the backend retrieves relevant document sections using the vector database.
4. The search results are processed by the summarization service to generate concise summaries.
5. The frontend displays the results and summaries to the user.

## Scalability
- The modular architecture allows for easy addition of new features, such as multi-language support or voice-to-text capabilities.
- Cloud deployment (e.g., AWS or Azure) ensures that the application can scale to handle increased user demand.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust framework for developing an intelligent document search and summarization tool, leveraging modern AI technologies to enhance user experience and efficiency.
