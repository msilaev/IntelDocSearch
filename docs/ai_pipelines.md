# AI Pipelines for Intelligent Document Search and Summarization Tool

## Overview
This document outlines the AI pipelines utilized in the Intelligent Document Search and Summarization Tool. The primary focus is on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance document search and summarization capabilities.

## AI Models Used
1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
   - **OpenAI GPT**: Utilized for natural language understanding and generation.
   - **Llama**: An alternative LLM for processing and generating text.
   - **Claude**: Another LLM option for various NLP tasks.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - Combines retrieval of relevant document sections with generative capabilities of LLMs to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

## Pipeline Components
1. **Document Upload and Preprocessing**:
   - Users upload documents in various formats (PDF, Word, plain text).
   - Documents are preprocessed to extract text and metadata.

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Text from documents is converted into embeddings using models like Sentence Transformers.
   - These embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

3. **Semantic Search**:
   - User queries are transformed into embeddings.
   - The vector database is queried to retrieve the most relevant document sections based on semantic similarity.

4. **Response Generation**:
   - Retrieved sections are fed into the LLM to generate context-aware responses.
   - The LLM can also summarize the relevant sections to provide concise insights.

5. **Summarization**:
   - Highlighted sections can be summarized using optimized LLM models.
   - Summaries include key points and relevant metadata (e.g., document title, section headers).

## Performance Considerations
- **Latency**: Monitor the response time of LLMs and retrieval processes to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Accuracy**: Evaluate the precision and recall of search results to maintain high-quality outputs.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of voice-to-text capabilities for spoken queries.
- Support for multi-language document processing.
- Implementation of a feedback loop to fine-tune model performance based on user interactions.

## Conclusion
The AI pipelines in this project leverage advanced models and techniques to provide an efficient and intelligent document search and summarization experience. Continuous improvements and user feedback will drive the evolution of these capabilities.
