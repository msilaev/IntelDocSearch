# Database Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of the vector database into the Intelligent Document Search and Summarization Tool. The vector database is crucial for enabling semantic search capabilities and efficient retrieval of document embeddings.

## Vector Database Selection
For this project, we have chosen [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), or [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) as potential options for the vector database. Each of these databases offers unique features that support high-dimensional vector storage and retrieval.

## Integration Steps

1. **Installation**:
   - Install the necessary libraries for the chosen vector database. For example, if using Pinecone:
     ```
     pip install pinecone-client
     ```

2. **Configuration**:
   - Set up the database connection in the `vector_db.py` utility file. This includes initializing the client and configuring the database parameters.

3. **Storing Document Embeddings**:
   - After processing documents, generate embeddings using the selected LLM. Store these embeddings in the vector database along with relevant metadata (e.g., document ID, title).
   - Example function to store embeddings:
     ```python
     def store_embeddings(document_id, embedding, metadata):
         # Code to store the embedding in the vector database
     ```

4. **Retrieving Relevant Sections**:
   - Implement a function to query the vector database based on user search queries. This function should convert the query into an embedding and retrieve the most similar document embeddings.
   - Example function to retrieve embeddings:
     ```python
     def retrieve_similar_embeddings(query_embedding):
         # Code to retrieve similar embeddings from the vector database
     ```

5. **Updating and Deleting Entries**:
   - Provide functionality to update or delete document embeddings as needed, ensuring the database remains current with the latest document versions.

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor the latency of database queries and optimize the embedding storage and retrieval processes to ensure quick response times for user queries.
- Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to enhance performance.

## Conclusion
Integrating a vector database is essential for the Intelligent Document Search and Summarization Tool, enabling efficient semantic search and retrieval of insights from user-uploaded documents. Proper implementation will enhance the overall user experience and the effectiveness of the application.
